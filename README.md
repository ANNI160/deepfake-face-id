# Deepfake Detection and Face Recognition System

This project implements a deepfake detection and face recognition system using EfficientNetB4 and Dlib with OpenCV. It also integrates with blockchain (via Web3.py) to log verified identities securely.

##  Features

-  Deepfake image detection using EfficientNetB4
-  Face recognition using Dlib & `face_recognition` library
-  Blockchain logging using Web3.py
-  Tkinter/Streamlit GUI for easy interaction

##  Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- Dlib
- Web3.py
- Streamlit / Tkinter

##  Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/deepfake-face-id.git
   cd deepfake-face-id
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or convert into a Python script.

##  Future Scope

- Support for audio/video deepfake detection
- Multi-user authentication interface
- Integration with smart contracts (Ethereum via Infura)
